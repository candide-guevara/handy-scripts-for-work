# handy_scripts_for_work
Collection of scripts and configuration files I use at home and at work.

## How to get started ?
* Install/Open a bash terminal (version >= 3.1)
* Got to the root of the repository
* run `./install -i` (careful you may not like my vimrc!)
* run `helpme -f`
 
## Repo structure
* `myconf.d` : shell scripts to be sourced on bash startup
* `configuration` : settings for gdb, git, vimrc ...
* `scripts` : Examples on how to use some tools
* `scripts/awk` : programs to parse and format text files (logs, man ...)
